Zicong dove into a topic entirely new to him: \"Deep Learning based Compression methods for Holographic Displays\". These displays are an emerging field with transformative potential for next-generation augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets, and desktop 3D displays. Firstly, Zicong quickly mastered the replication of established hologram simulation algorithms involving light propagation techniques in free space, and learned to simulate holograms as if displayed using a holographic display. Through a rigorous series of experiments, Zicong generated structured guidance on the performance of learned hologram compression algorithms. In this context, Zicong is focused on Variational Autoencoder and Neural Implicit Representation structures. Zicong's well prepared documentation and assessments formulated the basis of a submission to the prestigious SIGGRAPH 2025 Poster Track.</p> <p> </p> We evaluate the performance of four common learned models utilizing Implicit Neural Representation (INR) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structures for compressing phase-only holograms in holographic displays.. <p>Zicong further elevated the quality of his work by collaborating with industrial and academic partners, including Josef Spjut of NVIDIA, Yicheng Zhan of UCL and Kaan Ak\u015fit. As of 10 August 2025, Zicogn Peng's work was accepted and presented at SIGGRAPH 2025. Zicong\u2019s journey serves as an exemplary model for beginners in any scientific field, proving that motivation, attentive mentorship, and active engagement with the collaborators can lead to remarkable success.

Their work demonstrated that this learned lens representation could accurately raytrace optical beams for simple imaging tasks, an interesting starting point for a more complete investigation in the future.

We present a new technique that we name Super Stereoscopy (SS3D) to provide a convenient solution to these problems. Regular stereoscopic glasses are replaced by SS3D glasses which deliver at least two parallax images per eye through pinholes equipped with light selective filters. The pinholes generate blur-free retinal images so as to enable correct accommodation, while the delivery of multiple parallax images per eye creates an approximate blur effect for defocused objects. Experiments performed with cameras and human viewers indicate that the technique works as desired. In case two, pinholes equipped with color filters per eye are used; the technique can be used on a regular stereoscopic display by only uploading a new content, without requiring any change in display hardware, driver, or frame rate. Apart from some tolerable loss in display brightness and decrease in natural spatial resolution limit of the eye because of pinholes, the technique is quite promising for comfortable and realistic 3D vision, especially enabling the display of close objects that are not possible to display and comfortably view on regular 3DTV and cinema.},\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>From Sound to Sight: Using Audio Processing to enable Visible Light Communication</p> <p></p> <p>Stefan Schmid,  D.

The first DEP tracker forms an exit pupil pair for a single viewer in a defined space with low intraocular crosstalk using a pair of moving shutter glasses located within the optical system. A display prototype using the first DEP tracker is constructed from a pair of laser projectors, pupil-forming optics, moving shutter glasses at an intermediate pupil plane, an image relay lens, and a Gabor superlens based viewing screen. The left and right eye images are presented time-sequentially to a single viewer and seen as a 3D image without wearing glasses and allows the viewer to move within a region of 40 cm {\\texttimes} 20 cm in the lateral plane, and 30 cm along the axial axis. The second DEP optics can move the exit pupil location dynamically in a much larger 3D space by using a custom spatial light modulator (SLM) forming an array of shutters. Simultaneous control of multiple exit pupils in both lateral and axial axes is demonstrated for the first time and provides a viewing volume with an axial extent of 0.6{\\textminus}3 m from the screen and within a lateral viewing angle of {\\textpm} 20{\\textdegree} for multiple viewers. This system has acceptable crosstalk (\\&amp;lt; 5\\%) between the stereo image pairs. In this novel version of the display the optical system is used as an advanced dynamic backlight for a liquid crystal display (LCD). This has advantages in terms of overall display size as there is no requirement for an intermediate image, and in image quality. This system has acceptable crosstalk (\\&amp;lt; 5\\%) between the stereo image pairs.},\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Multi-view autostereoscopic projection display using rotating screen</p> <p></p> <p> Spotlight on Optics</p> <p>Osman Eldes,  Kaan Ak\u015fit  and Hakan Urey</p> <p> Publisher site Manuscript Video</p>  Bibtex <pre><code>@article{Eldes:13,\nauthor = {Osman Eldes and Kaan Ak\\c{s}it and Hakan Urey},\njournal = {Opt.

Additionally, under identical training schedules, both SIREN and FilmSIREN frequently satisfied the early stopping criterion near 2000 epochs.

Keeping payload embedder as a fully connected layers is sufficient to encode the information after experimentation.

In this way, our method reconstructs a multiplanar three-dimensional target scene using consecutive multi-color holograms and persistence of vision. We co-optimize multi-color holograms and required intensity levels from each light source using a gradient descent-based optimizer with a combination of application-specific loss terms.

When holographic displays reconstruct scenes with brightness levels beyond the peak intensity of their corresponding color channels, the result could often lead to darker images than the intended levels and produce visual distortions or color mismatches (see conventional case below figure). In such cases, the dynamic range of the target is typically limited to the peak intensity of the light source, which is often not enough to deliver the desired visual experience.</p> <p></p> <p>Without altering hardware, we argue that holographic displays could dedicate extra time to each color channel to improve their perceived brightness levels, as demonstrated in below figure. Our work aims to improve holographic displays' dynamic range by more effectively but aggressively utilizing color primaries and holograms. For this purpose, we introduce a new Computer-Generated Holography (CGH) driving scheme. In this scheme, multi-color holograms simultaneously operate over multiple wavelengths of light and provide 3D multiplanar images.  We calculate multi-color holograms using a Gradient Descent (GD) based solver guided by a combination of application-specific loss functions.

Simply daisy-chaining multiple models or training dedicated models can lead to model management issues and exhaust computational resources. In contrast, our flexible method unlocks consistent high quality perceptual effects with reasonable compute, supporting various permutations at varied intensities using adjectives in text prompts (e.g. mildly, lightly). Text-guidance provides ease of use for dynamic requirements such as creative processes. To train our model, we propose a dataset containing source and perceptually enhanced images with corresponding text prompts.

However, conventional vision-based systems used in these systems often struggle with achieving high precision and accuracy, particularly when dealing with complex environments or fast-moving objects. To address these limitations, we investigate Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI), an emerging optical tracking method that offers promising potential for improving pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, our proposed LSI-Based Tracking leverages the captures from a lensless camera and a retro-reflector marker with a coded aperture to achieve multi-axis rotational pose estimation with high precision. Our extensive trials using our in-house built testbed have shown that SpecTrack achieves an accuracy of \\(0.31^\\circ\\) (std=\\(0.43^\\circ\\)) , significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and improving accuracy up to \\(200\\%\\).</p>"},{"location":"publications/spec_track/#proposed-method","title":"Proposed Method","text":"<p>We aim to remotely obtain multiple absolute rotation angles from a coded retroreflective marker by utilizing the overlapping patterns generated by the multi-wavelength laser. the laser beam from the source (\\(S\\)) hits an arbitrary point (\\(P\\)) and diffracts at slightly different angles due to the different wavelengths (\\(\\lambda_0\\) and \\(\\lambda_1\\)). This phenomenon shows a correlation between the surface rotation angle and the captured speckle image.</p> <p>The first image below shows the structure of the proposed sensor, which contains a bare sensor, laser source and beam splitter (\\(10~mm \\times 10~mm\\)). The beam splitter is placed in front of the bare imaging sensor to ensure that most of the light reflected from the marker covers a large area of the sensor. Additionally, this co-axial optical layout eliminates the light source's lateral offsets, simplifying the speckle behavior in the rotations.</p> <p></p> <p>We can tell from the image below that the captured image formed overlappings in when the surface rotates \\(10^\\circ\\) in the y-axis.</p> <p></p> <p>Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to get the magnitudes of speckle image from various poses (y-axis roation, z-axis rotations, and z-axis displacements) or coded surface reveals interpretable patterns:</p> <p></p> <p>We employ a shallow neural network to handle the non-linearities of physical aspects and estimate the absolute rotation angles from speckle patterns.</p> <p></p> <p>Firstly, we preprocess the captured monochrome speckle frames \\(I_{speckle}\\) (\\(640\\times360\\)~px) by transforming them into the frequency domain \\(\\mathcal{F}(I_{speckle})\\) using the FFT. Then the frames are central cropped and concatenated into a tensor \\([\\mathcal{F}(I_{\\text{speckle}, i})]_{i=1}^5\\) with a shape of \\((5,320,180)\\). From our practical experiences, this concatenated frame tensor provides more robust results when the marker is in motion because it incorporates temporal information. After that, we feed the samples into three convolutional blocks, each comprising a 2D convolution layer, batch normalization, ReLU activation function, and max pooling. After the convolution, the sample is flattened and inputted into a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) containing six linear layers each layer is followed by a batch normalization and ReLu activation function.  The final layer of MLP outputs the rotation angles \\(\\theta_y\\), \\(\\theta_z\\) and the arbitrary depth \\(d_z\\).</p> <p>Since capturing samples in all six Degrees Of Freedom simultaneously is physically difficult, we focus on capturing the speckle imaging as the marker rotates in the z-axis and y-axis. We add controlled close-loop motors to a rotary stage to automatically capture the speckle images when the marker is rotated in various axes, as shown below. During the data collection, we control the motors to rotate the marker from \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(40^\\circ\\) on the y-axis and \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(90^\\circ\\) the z-axis.
