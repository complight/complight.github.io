[Zicong Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lpi8DvIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) demonstrated exceptional motivation and outstanding implementation skills throughout his master’s thesis work.
Zicong dove into a topic entirely new to him: **"Deep Learning based Compression methods for Holographic Displays"**.
These displays are an emerging field with transformative potential for next-generation augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets, and desktop 3D displays.
Firstly, Zicong quickly mastered the replication of established hologram simulation algorithms involving light propagation techniques in free space, and learned to simulate holograms as if displayed using a holographic display.
Through a rigorous series of experiments, Zicong generated structured guidance on the performance of learned hologram compression algorithms.
In this context, Zicong is focused on Variational Autoencoder and Neural Implicit Representation structures.
Zicong's well prepared documentation and assessments formulated the basis of a submission to the prestigious **SIGGRAPH 2025 Poster Track**.

Zicong further elevated the quality of his work by collaborating with industrial and academic partners, including [Josef Spjut](https://josef.spjut.me/) of NVIDIA, [Yicheng Zhan](https://albertgary.github.io/) of UCL and [Kaan Akşit](https://kaanaksit.com).
As of **10 August 2025**, Zicogn Peng's work was accepted and presented at **[SIGGRAPH 2025](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/presentation/?id=pos_195&sess=sess404)**.
Zicong’s journey serves as an exemplary model for beginners in any scientific field, proving that motivation, attentive mentorship, and active engagement with the collaborators can lead to remarkable success.
Throughout this process, he developed a robust technical skillset, a deep understanding of scientific methodology, and improved communication skills—opening doors to future Ph.D. studentship opportunities in [Koç University](https://ku.edu.tr).
