[Zicong Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lpi8DvIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) demonstrated exceptional motivation and outstanding implementation skills throughout his master’s thesis work.
Zicong dove into a topic entirely new to him: **"Deep Learning based Compression methods for Holographic Displays"**.
These displays are an emerging field with transformative potential for next-generation augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets, and desktop 3D displays.
Firstly, Zicong quickly mastered the replication of established hologram simulation algorithms involving light propagation techniques in free space, and learned to simulate holograms as if displayed using a holographic display.
Through a rigorous series of experiments, Zicong generated structured guidance on the performance of learned hologram compression algorithms.
In this context, Zicong is focused on Variational Autoencoder and Neural Implicit Representation structures.
Zicong's well prepared documentation and assessments formulated the basis of a submission to the prestigious **SIGGRAPH 2025 Poster Track**.

Zicong further elevated the quality of his work by collaborating with industrial and academic partners, including [Josef Spjut](https://josef.spjut.me/) of NVIDIA, [Yicheng Zhan](https://albertgary.github.io/) of UCL and [Kaan Akşit](https://kaanaksit.com).
As of **10 August 2025**, Zicong Peng's work was accepted and presented at **[SIGGRAPH 2025](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/presentation/?id=pos_195&sess=sess404)**.
Zicong’s journey serves as an exemplary model for beginners in any scientific field, proving that motivation, attentive mentorship, and active engagement with the collaborators can lead to remarkable success.
Throughout this process, he developed a robust technical skillset, a deep understanding of scientific methodology, and improved communication skills—opening doors to future Ph.D. studentship opportunities in [Koç University](https://ku.edu.tr) under the guidance of Professor [Hakan Urey](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/hurey/).


## Implicit Neural Representations for Optical Raytracing

    **Presented by:** [Shive Sinaei](https://www.xr.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/team/), [**Chuanjun Zheng**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9Jk_LC8AAAAJ&), [Kaan Akşit](https://kaanaksit.com), and [Daisuke Iwai](https://daisukeiwai.org/).

    **Location:** Convention Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada

    **Time:** Monday-Thursday, 10-14 August 2025

    **Session:** [**Poster Track**](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/presentation/?id=pos_198&sess=sess406)

[**Chuanjun Zheng**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9Jk_LC8AAAAJ) concluded his remote internship in our laboratory, collaborating with external partners from the [University of Osaka](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en).
During this collaboration, Chuanjun mentored first year Ph.D. student [Shiva Sinaei](https://www.xr.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/team/) by sharing insights from his earlier experimtns on implicit neural representations.
Together, Chuanjun and Shiva identified an implicit neural representation capable of modeling optical lenses as a learned component.
Their work demonstrated that this learned lens representation could accurately raytrace optical beams for simple imaging tasks, an interesting starting point for a more complete investigation in the future.
As Chuanjun wraps up his internship, Chuanjun is set to begin a new chapter at the [University of Hawai'i at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/), where Chuanjun will work under the supervision of [Huaijin (George) Chen](https://hgchen.com/).
