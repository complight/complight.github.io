## Outreach
We host a Slack group with more than 250 members.
This Slack group focuses on the topics of rendering, perception, displays and cameras.
The group is open to public and you can become a member by following [this link](../outreach/index.md).


## Zicong Peng
Zicong Peng demonstrated a high motivation and excellent implementation skills in his master thesis work. Zicong dove into a topic that he had no prior experiences, namely "Holographic Displays". More specifically, Zicong explored deep learning methods for compressing holograms effectively used in the holographic displays, an emerging topic and a potential candidate for the next generation of augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets and desktop 3D displays. Initially, Zicong has swiftly managed to replicate common learned methods and hologram simulation algorithms commonly used in the relevant literature. Later on, Zicong conducted a series of experiments with these algorithms, and generated a first of it's kind guidance on the performance of learned hologram compression algorithms. More over, Zicong has prepared an outstanding documentation of his assessments, which later he managed to submit to the prestigious poster track of SIGGRAPH 2025. Moreover, Zicong collaborated with industrial and academic partners to sharpen the quality of his submission to this venue. These partners include Josef Spjut of NVIDIA, and Yicheng Zhan of UCL. As of 10 August 2025, Zicong's work is accepted and presented at SIGGRAPH 2025 poster track. In our view, Zicong's case provide an exemplary path for beginners in any scientific field, showing that keeping up the motivation and will, carefully listening the guidance from the mentors, and closely engaging with others in the field are highly likely to converge to a an exemplary success story. In the entirerty of this thesis process, Zicong has acquired a proper technical skillset, knowledge on scientific method, and communication skills for technical collaborations, unlocking potential future possibilities for him in the academia in the near future.
