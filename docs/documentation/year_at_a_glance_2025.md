## Outreach
We host a Slack group with more than 250 members.
This Slack group focuses on the topics of rendering, perception, displays and cameras.
The group is open to public and you can become a member by following [this link](../outreach/index.md).


## Zicong Peng
Zicong Peng has demonstrated a high motivation and excellent implementation skills in his master thesis work. More specifically, Zicong has dived into a topic that Zicong had no prior experiences, Holographic Displays. Zicong explored deep learning methods in the context of his master thesis for compressing holograms effectively used in holographic displays, an emerging topic and a potential candidate for the next generation augmented reality glasses, virtual reality headsets and desktop 3D displays. Zicong has swiftly managed to replicate common learned methods and hologram simulation algorithms commonly used in the relevant literature. Zicong has conducted a series of experiments with these algorithms, and generated a first of it’s kind guidance on the performance of learned hologram compression algorithms. Zicong has prepared an outstanding documentation of his assessments, which later Zicong managed to submit to the prestigious poster track of SIGGRAPH 2025. Moreover, Zicong collaborated with industrial and academic partners to sharpen his submission in the venue. These partners include Josef Spjut of NVIDIA, and Yicheng Zhan of UCL. Zicong’s case provide an examplery path for beginners in any scientific field, showing that keeping up the motivation and will, carefully listening the guidance from the mentors, and closely engaging with others in the field are highly likely to converge to a an examplery success story.
